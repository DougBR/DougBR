Since 2012, I've been working in web development, helping companies and startups build and scale their products from the ground up using modern, cutting-edge technologies.
Over the last seven years, I've specialized in functional programming, with a strong focus on Elixir. During this time, I've led teams as a Tech Lead and contributed to several open source initiatives.
